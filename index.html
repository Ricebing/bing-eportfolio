<h2 class="mb-5">Reflections</h2>
<h3>Reflection 1: Sustainability and Viable Systems</h3>
<p>While running a 500M-parameter language model on my personal computer for research, I unintentionally caused a noticeable increase in household electricity usage. This experience revealed the often-invisible environmental and financial costs of AI systems, even at small scales.</p>
<p>This incident challenged my assumption that sustainability concerns only apply to large-scale systems. I learned that responsible engineering requires awareness of energy consumption, transparency, and consideration of broader impacts. Going forward, I aim to integrate sustainability thinking into both research and development decisions.</p>


<h3>Reflection 2: Professional Practice in Intercultural Contexts</h3>
<p>As an international student in Australia, I observed that many technically capable peers struggled to access IT internships due to language, cultural expectations, and local experience requirements.</p>
<p>This reflection helped me recognise that professional practice extends beyond technical competence. Communication norms, cultural awareness, and adaptability are critical. I now approach my professional development with greater emphasis on intercultural communication and contextual understanding.</p>

<h2 class="mb-5">Cover Letter (Excerpt)</h2>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my interest in the Graduate Engineer position at Industrus Engineering. As a recent Software Engineering graduate from the University of Technology Sydney, I gained hands-on experience leading and developing an AI-powered travel recommendation application, Leisura.</p>
<p>Through this project, I demonstrated ethical responsibility, proactive innovation, effective stakeholder communication, and leadership under pressure. These experiences have prepared me to contribute meaningfully in a professional engineering environment.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br><strong>Bing Xia</strong></p>
